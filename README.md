# Sentiment-Analysis-NLTK
Sentiment analysis for musical artists who committed suicide using NLTK technique.

Disclaimer: Here we do not seek to draw conclusions about suicide, nor if suicide is predictable by analyzing songs of musical artists, because suicide and mental health are complex issues that require a psychiatric and psychological approach that are beyond my knowledge. We simply want to show a sentiment analysis using NLTK (Natural language processing) technique, and obtain insights from age groups that committed suicide.
